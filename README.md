# How to (pre-)compute a ladder 


This is a C-language software library that provides optimized implementations of the Diffie-Hellman functions known as X25519 and X448 ([RFC-7748](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7748/)) for 64-bit architectures.

### Implementation Details
 * Prime field arithmetic is optimized for the 4th  and 6th generation of Intel Core processors (Haswell and Skylake micro-architectures).
 * Efficient integer multiplication using MULX instruction.
 * Integer additions accelerated with ADCX/ADOX instructions.
 * Key generation uses a read-only table of 8 KB (25 KB) for X25519 (X448).
 * It follows secure coding countermeasures.

### Compilation
Clone repository and configure project using the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) tool:

```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/armfazh/rfc7748_precomputed
 $ cd rfc7748_precomputed
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
```
You can specify the compiler as follows:
```sh
 $ CC=gcc cmake ..
 $ make
```

----

### Runing Companion Programs
Once compilation was done, you can run three companion programs. For running the benchmark program use:
```sh
 $ bin/bench
```

For running the tests program use:
```sh
 $ bin/tests
```

For running a sample program use:
```sh
 $ bin/samples
```
